🛠️ Standard Git Workflow

🧱 1. Initialize or Clone a Repository
If starting a new project:
```bash
git init
```
If working on an existing project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

🔍 2. Check the Status of Files
See what's changed or staged:
```bash
git status
```

📂 3. Create a Branch (Optional but Recommended)
Create and switch to a new branch for a feature or bugfix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature-branch-name
```

📝 4. Make Changes and Stage Them
After editing files, stage the files you want to commit:
```bash
git add <file_name>         # stage one file
git add .                   # stage all files
```

💬 5. Commit the Changes
Save a snapshot of your changes with a message:
```bash
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"
```

🔄 6. Pull Latest Changes from Remote (Before Pushing)
Update your branch with the latest remote changes:
```bash
git pull origin main        # or whatever branch you're working with
```

🚀 7. Push the Changes to Remote Repository
Send your commits to GitHub or another remote:
```bash
git push origin feature-branch-name
```

🔁 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to GitHub and open a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch.

✅ 9. Merge the Branch
After approval/review, merge it:

On GitHub (via PR), or

Locally:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git merge feature-branch-name
git push origin main
```

🧹 10. Delete the Feature Branch
Clean up the old branch:
```bash
git branch -d feature-branch-name       # delete local branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch-name  # delete remote branch
```

Backup your code in the cloud.

Share code with others.

Example: git remote, git push, git fetch.
